### Why people love this format on X
One image → split into 4 → upload in order → people swipe and get hit with the full cursed picture.  
Perfect for reaction faces, progress pics, "expectation vs reality", jumpscares, etc.

### ✨ Features
- Super simple GUI file picker (no terminal needed after setup)
- Automatically handles odd dimensions (no weird seams)
- **Optional square crop mode** — fixes ugly timeline previews on tall images
- Saves the 4 parts **right next to your original file**
- Shows exact upload order (1→2→3→4)
- It's RECOMMENDED that you use a portrait image, with dimensions like 500x300 or variations that use the same ratio. You can get creative here.
