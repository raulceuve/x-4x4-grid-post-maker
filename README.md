# x-4x4-grid-post-maker
A python script that lets you create a 4x4 collage for posting.
You only need to install python and pillow. Then cut an image to a portrait shape, for example 500x300, and then when you open the script, you only need to select the image, and then it will give you the 4 images and the order that you need to upload them.
