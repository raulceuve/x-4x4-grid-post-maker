*(replace with your own short demo GIF — record yourself selecting an image → getting 4 parts → uploading to X)*

### Why people love this format on X
One image → split into 4 → upload in order → people swipe and get hit with the full cursed picture.  
Perfect for reaction faces, progress pics, "expectation vs reality", jumpscares, etc.

### ✨ Features
- Super simple GUI file picker (no terminal needed after setup)
- Automatically handles odd dimensions (no weird seams)
- **Optional square crop mode** — fixes ugly timeline previews on tall images
- Saves the 4 parts **right next to your original file**
- Shows exact upload order (1→2→3→4)

### 🚀 Installation (30 seconds)

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.8+**  
   → Most Linux / macOS have it already  
   → Windows? Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install **Pillow** (the only dependency)
